Starting /var/tmp checks...
CIS Section: 1.1.2.5.1 – Ensure /var/tmp is a separate partition

Current State:
No /var/tmp partition found

Hardened State:
/var/tmp should be a separate mount using its own partition

Audit Result: **FAIL**

Rationale:
The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var/tmp directory is world-writable, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var/tmp and cause potential disruption to daemons as the disk is full. Configuring /var/tmp as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system.

CIS Section: 1.1.2.5.2 – Ensure nodev option set on /var/tmp partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var/tmp should be mounted with nodev enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Since the /var/tmp filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users cannot create a block or character special devices in /var/tmp.

CIS Section: 1.1.2.5.3 – Ensure nosuid option set on /var/tmp partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var/tmp should be mounted with nosuid enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Since the /var/tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to ensure that users cannot create setuid files in /var/tmp.

---

CIS Section: 1.1.2.5.4 – Ensure noexec option set on /var/tmp partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var/tmp should be mounted with noexec enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Since the /var/tmp filesystem is only intended for temporary file storage, set this option to ensure that users cannot run executable binaries from /var/tmp.
