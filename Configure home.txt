CIS Section: 1.1.2.3.1 – Ensure /home is a separate partition

Current State:
No /home partition found

Hardened State:
/home should be a separate mount using its own partition

Audit Result: **FAIL**

Rationale:
Configuring /home as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options and reduce risk of resource exhaustion or privilege escalation. It limits the impact user activity can have on the entire system.

CIS Section: 1.1.2.3.2 – Ensure nodev option set on /home partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/home should be mounted with nodev enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Since the /home filesystem is not intended to support devices, setting this option ensures that users cannot create block or character special devices, reducing the attack surface.

---

CIS Section: 1.1.2.3.3 – Ensure nosuid option set on /home partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/home should be mounted with nosuid enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Setting the nosuid option on /home prevents users from creating or using setuid files, which helps mitigate privilege escalation risks.
