CIS Section: 1.1.2.4.1 – Ensure /var is a separate partition

Current State:
No /var partition found

Hardened State:
/var should be a separate mount using its own partition

Audit Result: **FAIL**

Rationale:
The reasoning for mounting /var on a separate partition is as follows.
The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var directory may contain world-writable files and directories, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. It will essentially have the whole disk available to fill up and impact the system as a whole. In addition, other operations on the system could fill up the disk unrelated to /var and cause unintended behavior across the system as the disk is full. See man auditd.conf for details.
Configuring /var as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system. Other options allow for specific behavior. See man mount for exact details regarding filesystem-independent and filesystem-specific options.
An example of exploiting /var may be an attacker establishing a hard-link to a system setuid program and wait for it to be updated. Once the program was updated, the hard-link would be broken and the attacker would have his own copy of the program. If the program happened to have a security vulnerability, the attacker could continue to exploit the known flaw.

CIS Section: 1.1.2.4.2 – Ensure nodev option set on /var partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var should be mounted with nodev enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Since the /var filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users cannot create a block or character special devices in /var.

CIS Section: 1.1.2.4.3 – Ensure nosuid option set on /var partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var should be mounted with nosuid enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Since the /var filesystem is only intended for variable files such as logs, set this option to ensure that users cannot create setuid files in /var.
