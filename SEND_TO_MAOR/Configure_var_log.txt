Starting /var/log checks...
CIS Section: 1.1.2.6.1 – Ensure /var/log is a separate partition

Current State:
No /var/log partition found

Hardened State:
/var/log should be a separate mount using its own partition

Audit Result: **FAIL**

Rationale:
The default installation only creates a single / partition. Since the /var/log directory contains log files which can grow quite large, there is a risk of resource exhaustion. Configuring /var/log as its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as noexec/nosuid/nodev. These options limit an attacker's ability to create exploits on the system.

CIS Section: 1.1.2.6.2 – Ensure nodev option set on /var/log partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var/log should be mounted with nodev enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Since the /var/log filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure that users cannot create block or character special devices in /var/log.

---

CIS Section: 1.1.2.6.3 – Ensure nosuid option set on /var/log partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var/log should be mounted with nosuid enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Since the /var/log filesystem is only intended for log files, set this option to ensure that users cannot create setuid files in /var/log.

---

CIS Section: 1.1.2.6.4 – Ensure noexec option set on /var/log partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var/log should be mounted with noexec enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Since the /var/log filesystem is only intended for log files, set this option to ensure that users cannot run executable binaries from /var/log.
