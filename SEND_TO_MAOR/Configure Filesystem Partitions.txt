CIS Section: 1.1.2.1.1 – Ensure /tmp is a separate partition

Current State:
No /tmp partition found

Hardened State:
/tmp should be a separate mount using tmpfs or its own partition

Audit Result: **FAIL**

Rationale:
Making /tmp its own file system allows an administrator to set additional mount options such as the noexec option, making /tmp useless for an attacker to install executable code.

Since the /tmp filesystem is not intended to support devices, set this option to ensure users cannot create a block or character special devices in /tmp.

Set this option to prevent users from creating setuid files in /tmp.
