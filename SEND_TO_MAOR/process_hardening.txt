CIS Section: 1.5.1 – Ensure ASLR is enabled
---

Rationale:
Randomly placing virtual memory regions makes it harder for attackers to exploit memory-related vulnerabilities.

Current State:
kernel.randomize_va_space = 2
Audit Result: **PASS** – ASLR is enabled.


---
CIS Section: 1.5.2 – Ensure ptrace_scope is restricted
---

Rationale:
Restricting ptrace reduces the ability of compromised processes to inspect other processes, helping contain attacks.

Current State:
kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1
Audit Result: **PASS** – ptrace_scope is restricted.


---
CIS Section: 1.5.3 – Ensure core dumps are restricted
---

Rationale:
Core dumps can expose sensitive data. Restricting them limits attack surface and information leakage.

Current State:
No hard core dump limit found in limits.conf or limits.d.
fs.suid_dumpable = 2
Audit Result: **FAIL** – Core dump restrictions not fully enforced.


---
CIS Section: 1.5.4 – Ensure prelink is not installed
---

Rationale:
Prelink modifies binaries, making it difficult to track changes and potentially introducing security risks.

Current State: prelink is NOT installed.

Audit Result: **PASS** – prelink is not present.


---
CIS Section: 1.5.5 – Ensure Automatic Error Reporting is not enabled
---

Rationale:
Automatic crash reports may expose sensitive data like passwords and private logs.

Current State:
Enabled in /etc/default/apport:
enabled=1
apport.service status: active
Audit Result: **FAIL** – Apport error reporting is active or enabled.
