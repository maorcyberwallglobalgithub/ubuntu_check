Starting /var/log/audit checks...
CIS Section: 1.1.2.7.1 – Ensure /var/log/audit is a separate partition

Current State:
No /var/log/audit partition found

Hardened State:
/var/log/audit should be a separate mount using its own partition

Audit Result: **FAIL**

Rationale:
Since the /var/log/audit directory contains audit logs which can grow significantly, configuring it on a separate partition helps avoid resource exhaustion and allows security-restrictive mount options such as nodev, nosuid, and noexec.

CIS Section: 1.1.2.7.2 – Ensure nodev option set on /var/log/audit partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var/log/audit should be mounted with nodev enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Since /var/log/audit is not intended to support device files, the nodev option should be set to prevent creation of such devices.

---

CIS Section: 1.1.2.7.3 – Ensure nosuid option set on /var/log/audit partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var/log/audit should be mounted with nosuid enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
The nosuid option ensures users cannot create setuid files within /var/log/audit, reducing the risk of privilege escalation.

---

CIS Section: 1.1.2.7.4 – Ensure noexec option set on /var/log/audit partition

Current State:
Not mounted or no output returned

Hardened State:
/var/log/audit should be mounted with noexec enabled

Audit Result: **PASS**

Rationale:
Setting the noexec option on /var/log/audit ensures that executables cannot be run from this log directory, reducing exploitability.
