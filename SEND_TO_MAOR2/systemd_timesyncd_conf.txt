# =============================
# CIS Section 2.3.2.1 & 2.3.2.2 - systemd-timesyncd Configuration
# =============================

Rationale:
Ensuring time synchronization uses defined and trusted NTP servers prevents tampering or incorrect logging timestamps. systemd-timesyncd must be configured properly and enabled.

Current State:
/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf does not exist.

Best Practice / Expected Value:
/etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf should exist and define NTP and FallbackNTP values.

Audit Result: **FAIL**

Recommendation:
Create the file /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf and define trusted NTP servers in it.

Active: inactive

Best Practice / Expected Value:
