CIS Section: 5.4.1.1 – Ensure password expiration is configured
---

Current State:
PASS_MAX_DAYS is 

Audit Result: PASS

Rationale:
Limiting password lifetime reduces the window of opportunity for attackers.

Best Practice:
Set PASS_MAX_DAYS to 365 or less

Recommendation:
Edit /etc/login.defs and set PASS_MAX_DAYS 365


---
CIS Section: 5.4.1.2 – Ensure minimum password age is configured
---

Current State:
PASS_MIN_DAYS is ; Issues found: 

Audit Result: FAIL

Rationale:
Prevents rapid password change to circumvent reuse policies.

Best Practice:
Set PASS_MIN_DAYS to 1 or more

Recommendation:
Edit /etc/login.defs and set PASS_MIN_DAYS 1


---
CIS Section: 5.4.1.3 – Ensure password expiration warning days is configured
---

Current State:
PASS_WARN_AGE is ; Issues found: 

Audit Result: FAIL

Rationale:
Gives users time to update passwords securely before expiration.

Best Practice:
Set PASS_WARN_AGE to 7 or more

Recommendation:
Edit /etc/login.defs and set PASS_WARN_AGE 7


---
CIS Section: 5.4.1.4 – Ensure strong password hashing algorithm is configured
---

Current State:
ENCRYPT_METHOD is 

Audit Result: FAIL

Rationale:
Stronger hash algorithms protect passwords against brute-force attacks.

Best Practice:
Use SHA512 or YESCRYPT

Recommendation:
Edit /etc/login.defs and set ENCRYPT_METHOD YESCRYPT


---
CIS Section: 5.4.1.5 – Ensure inactive password lock is configured
---

Current State:
Default INACTIVE is -1

Audit Result: PASS

Rationale:
Inactive accounts are vulnerable to unnoticed compromises.

Best Practice:
Set default INACTIVE to 45 or less

Recommendation:
Run: useradd -D -f 45


---
CIS Section: 5.4.1.6 – Ensure all users last password change date is in the past
---

Current State:
All last password change dates are valid.

Audit Result: PASS

Rationale:
Future-dated password changes can bypass password expiration policies.

Best Practice:
Ensure all password change dates are in the past

Recommendation:
Use 'chage' to correct future-dated changes
